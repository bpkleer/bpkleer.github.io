In my work life so far, I have worked as a research assistant in teaching. During this time, I have also been involved in research projects temporarily. I am working on the EU Horizon project [G-EPIC](https://www.g-epic.eu) until September 2024.

In these research projects, I developed my skills in **planning** and **organizing projects** and discovered and consolidated my **strength in team collaboration**. In addition, I continuously expanded my skills in **applying** and **evaluating quantitative data analysis**.

One of my strengths lies in understanding large amounts of information, a crucial skill in my research endeavors. I have specialized in distilling complex information into meaningful insights, allowing for a deeper understanding of the topics covered.

Below, you will find an overview of my research projects.

#### Gender Empowerment Through Politics in the Classroom
##### Contract time: 02/2023 - 09/2024
##### Funded by: EU Horizon
##### PI (Germany): Simone Abendschön

G-EPIC aims to tackle the challenge of gendered political inequality from an intersectional perspective, through a novel research programme that broadly assesses how the gender gap in political participation is learnt through interaction in a social educational context. It proposes to develop a systematic approach, to gain understanding of the state of play on gendered political inequality and then to design, pilot and evaluate inclusive school-based interventions (didactics) that foster the political self-efficacy of disadvantaged young girls in six European countries (Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom). It also includes the formulation of policy recommendations and the drafting of a gender-sensitive regulatory framework.

"Gender Empowerment through Politics in Classrooms" (G-EPIC) is a 36-month project led by first class European academics in political science, sociology, gender studies, youth studies, and educational sciences, from Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Spain and The United Kingdom. It is funded by the European Commission's Horizon Europe Framework Programme and is designed to support the development of political self-confidence of girls and particularly those who are experiencing multiple forms of disadvantage.

#### Fundamental Conditions of Democracy: Inequality as Disturbing Factor of Democratic Consolidation (dissertation project)
#### Finished: 2022

In the 1990s and early 2000s, the economic shock in Central Eastern Europe (CEE) after the transformation was still tolerated, but with accession to the EU, it became clear that the expected level of prosperity would not be achieved for a long time. Nevertheless, the political systems of CEE could be considered consolidated. Recent developments in CEE are worrying: in Hungary, as in Poland, it is evident that anti-liberal parties are breaking the liberal consensus. These parties take up the dilemma of the expected development of prosperity and blame liberal democracy for this. Therefore, this thesis aims to assess to what extent effects are present between the different levels of political support and how inequality affects political support in consolidated liberal democracies in CEE.

For the purpose of this work, the origins of the theories of political support, political culture, empirical democracy research, and consolidation theory are linked. By analyzing three waves of the European Social Survey (2004, 2012, and 2018), it is possible to look at the development over time. First, in comparing the regions within states, items on political support are considered, making the first internal differences visible. Second, individual and regional effects on political support are tested in multi-level-models.

The results show that the expected effects are confirmed at the individual level: people who show lower support at the lower levels of political support also show lower support at the upper level. In part, an interaction effect from the respective lower levels and from the outcome assessment on the higher levels could be confirmed. Furthermore, although regional differences between the top/bottom regions could be made visible, the multi-level-models did not show any apparent effect of economic development. Instead of objective economic criteria, the subjective assessment is decisive. Furthermore, it could be shown that the proportion of dissatisfaction is an important explanatory factor for the level of political support and that support for emancipatory attitudes within a region also has an evident influence on political support.

#### Children in a German State Parliament: Lasting Learning Experiences of Primary Schoolchildren
##### Contract time: 12/2017 - 08/2018, 
##### Funded by: State Parliament Rhineland-Palatinate
##### PI's: Simone Abendschön, Thorsten Faas

The state parliament (Landtag) of the *Bundesland* Rhineland-Palatinate developed an out-of-school political education program in 2018, taking place in the *Landtag* itself. This new visiting program aimed exclusively at primary schoolchildren in grades 3 and 4. The program aimed at strengthening political knowledge and democratic understanding of children, especially with reference to the political context of the German federal *Land*. Within this out-of-school learning environment, the schoolchildren should develop an understanding of political decision-making and democratic processes in general. Among other elements, the visit program includes a simulation of a plenary session. To assess if this program impacted children's political orientations, we conducted an evaluation study that accompanied the program. A quasi-experimental design was set up to analyze the possible impact of the program on its participants. The following research questions were addressed: What level of political knowledge and political interest do the children have before they attend the program? To what extent does the program influence the children's political knowledge and interest levels? Are these effects lasting or only of a short-term nature? The findings can en-hance our understanding of the impact of out-of-school learning activities on the political knowledge and political interest of primary schoolchildren.
