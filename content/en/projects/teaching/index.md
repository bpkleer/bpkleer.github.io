As a research assistant at the Chair of Methods in Political Science, I have continuously taught in the Institute's degree programs, focusing on the practical teaching of empirical social research in the BA program in *Social Sciences*.

My interest in education is reflected in my experience training and supervising students (e.g., on final-year projects). My teaching roles have equipped me to **impart knowledge effectively**, prepare and **present complex content effectively**, **guide discussion**, and provide **constructive feedback** to facilitate learning.

I have also supervised/mentored students' theses and supported them in the writing process.

In teaching, I have always developed courses further and **designed**, **developed**, and **implemented** several **web-based training courses** as larger teaching projects. In these projects, I set the **planning and implementation as project manager** and **supervised** and managed **student assistants**.

In addition, I have created several **learning videos** on statistics and its application in R for the JLU and the FernUniversit√§t Hagen over the last few years.

In **application-oriented courses**, I have always emphasized integrating **project/collaboration tools** (such as Git) and, for example, enabling **automated checks of code submissions** via Git (see CI project below).
