## Teaching 

In my previous academic roles in the field of quantitative methods, I have designed practical teaching in empirical social research for the BA program *Social Sciences*. My commitment to education is evident in the training and mentoring of students, particularly with theses, where I **distill complex information into understandable insights** and provide **constructive feedback**.

I have developed several web-based training programs and, as project leader, have been responsible for the planning, implementation, and oversight of these teaching projects. A particular focus has been on integrating R and Git into applied courses to teach students how to use project and collaboration tools and enable automated checks of code submissions.

Additionally, I have created learning videos on statistics and R for Justus Liebig University Giessen and FernUniversit√§t Hagen to promote the practical application of statistical methods.

## Research
My research interests lie in political socialization as well as political attitude and support research. In this context, I have developed my skills in **planning** and **organizing research projects** and solidified my strengths in **team collaboration**. I have acquired extensive competencies in the **application** and **analysis (of complex) quantitative data**, enabling me to distill complex information into **meaningful insights**.

## Other

During my academic activities, I have given **international** scientific presentations, as well as public lectures in which I presented scientific content/problems to a wider audience. Furthermore, I published part of my work internationaly. In particular, I expanded my **interpersonal** and **cultural skills** at conferences and stays abroad.
