I am a trained political scientist and studied at the Universities of Cologne and Vienna before completing my doctorate at the University of Giessen. I am currently employed in the EU-funded project [**G-EPIC: Gender Empowerment through Politics In Classrooms**](https://g-epic.eu) until September 2024. Besides, I was visiting postdoc at the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco in Recife, Brazil, from October 2023 to March 2024. I have a broad knowledge of quantitative data analysis, which I have applied in various research projects. I have strengthened my ability to conceptualize, plan, and execute projects through research and teaching projects. 

I demonstrated my interpersonal and cultural skills at international conferences/workshops and, most recently, during a six-month stay abroad. These experiences in (international) teams have sharpened my ability to operate and contribute effectively in diverse environments.
