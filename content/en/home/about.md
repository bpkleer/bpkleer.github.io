I am a social scientist with a strong focus on quantitative analyses and methods. I am currently seeking **new challenges** in the field of Data Science in ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡º or ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· to **apply my skills in data-driven decision-making and innovative research**.

Before completing my PhD at the University of Giessen, I studied at the Universities of Cologne and Vienna, where I successfully designed and implemented projects. International research stays, conferences, and working in international teams have strengthened my intercultural and team-oriented skills. I look forward to working in dynamic environments and contributing to the advancement of data-driven solutions.
