I am a social scientist with a strong focus on quantitative analysis and methods. Currently, I am seeking new challenges in dynamic, diverse, and international environments (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º or ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·), contributing to the advancement of data-driven solutions with my knowledge and amplifying my knowledge and understanding. 

Before completing my PhD at the University of Giessen, I studied at the Universities of Cologne and Vienna, where I successfully designed and implemented projects. My international research stays, conferences, and work in international teams have strengthened my intercultural and teamwork skills. I look forward to collaborating in dynamic, diverse, and international environments in ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º or ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· applying my analytical and technical skills in data-driven decision-making and expanding my knowledge further.
