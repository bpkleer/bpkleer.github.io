I am a social scientist with a strong focus on quantitative analysis and methods. Currently, I am seeking **new challenges** in the field of **Data Science** in ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º or ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· to apply my analytical and technical skills in data-driven decision-making and innovative research.

Before completing my PhD at the University of Giessen, I studied at the Universities of Cologne and Vienna, where I successfully designed and implemented projects. My international research stays, conferences, and work in international teams have strengthened my intercultural and teamwork skills. I look forward to working in dynamic environments and contributing to the advancement of data-driven solutions.
