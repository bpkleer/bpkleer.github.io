I am a trained social scientist with a strong focus on quantitative analysis and methods. I am currently looking for new opportunities within or outside academia in ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º or ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· where I can utilize my skills in a variety of ways to drive data-driven decision making, innovation/research and/or teaching.

Before completing my doctorate at the University of Giessen, I studied at the Universities of Cologne and Vienna. Through projects (research and teaching) I have strengthened my ability to conceptualize, plan and implement projects. In recent years, I have had two international research stays: Universidade Federal de Pernambuco in Recife, Brazil and Universidad de Carlos III in Madrid. During these research stays and at international conferences/workshops, I have demonstrated my interpersonal and cultural skills. These experiences in (international) teams have sharpened my ability to work and contribute effectively in different environments. I am currently employed in the EU-funded project [**G-EPIC: Gender Empowerment through Politics In Classrooms**](https://g-epic.eu) until September 2024. Further information can be found in the [**RÃ©sumÃ©**](https://bpkleer.github.io/files/resume-kleer-en.pdf).
