My interest in education is reflected in my experience training and supervising students (e.g., on final-year projects). My teaching roles have equipped me to impart knowledge successfully, prepare and present complex content effectively, guide discussions, and provide constructive feedback to facilitate learning.</description>

      <description>My research interests lie in political socialization and political attitude/support research. Below, you will find an overview of the research projects.
In smaller and more extensive research projects, I developed my skills in planning and organizing projects and discovering and consolidating my strength in team collaboration. In addition, I steadily expanded my skills in the application and evaluation of quantitative data analysis.
One of my strengths lies in understanding large amounts of information, a crucial skill in my research endeavors.</description>
