      <description>As a research assistant at the Chair of Methods in Political Science, I have continuously taught in the Institute&amp;rsquo;s degree programs, focusing on the practical teaching of empirical social research in the BA program in Social Sciences.
My interest in education is reflected in my experience training and supervising students (e.g., on final-year projects). My teaching roles have equipped me to impart knowledge effectively, prepare and present complex content effectively, guide discussion, and provide constructive feedback to facilitate learning.</description>
